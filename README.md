# Minimax Logic Implementation in Python
## Description
This project is a practice in logic using the Minimax algorithm in Python. The goal is to implement and understand how the Minimax algorithm works, which is used in two-player games to find the best possible move by simulating different scenarios.

## Features
Implementation of the Minimax algorithm in Python.

Usage examples applied to a test game.

Comments and explanations in the code to facilitate understanding.

## Requirements
Python 3.8 or higher
